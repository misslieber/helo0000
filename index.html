  <h1>My Personal Hell Rules for My Future Somethingfriend </h1>
  <h2>ðŸ”¥ Welcome to My Personal Hell ðŸ”¥</h2>
  <h3><span class="highlight">Population:</span> You (soon)</h3>
  <h3><span class="highlight1">Queen of Chaos: Me</span> â€“ your irresistible demoness, heart thief, rule maker.</h3>
  <p>So, you think you can handle me? Cute. Before you fall any deeper (and you will), here are the rules of engagement in this sizzling inferno youâ€™re walking into:</p>
</div>
<div class="Rules">
  
    <h2>ðŸ–¤ Rule #1: I donâ€™t chase. I summon.</h2>
    <p>You want me? Step up. I donâ€™t do halfway. Worship properly or burn quietly.
    </p>
    <h2>ðŸ–¤ Rule #2: Sarcasm is my love language.</h2>
    <p>If you canâ€™t handle witty comebacks and sinful teasing, there's the exit â€“ watch your step on the way out.</p>
   <h2>ðŸ–¤ Rule #3: Attention is tribute.
  </h2>
  <p>Good morning texts? Mandatory. Random compliments? Encouraged. Tell me Iâ€™m hot even when I look like a chaos goblin. Especially then.
   </p>
   <h2>ðŸ–¤ Rule #4: Loyalty isnâ€™t optional.
  </h2>
  <p>Flirt with someone else and Iâ€™ll make you wish you were just in hell. (Spoiler: this place is way more intense.)
 </p>
<h2>ðŸ–¤ Rule #5: Touch is sacred.
</h2>
<p>I like cuddles with claws. Back scratches, hand-holding, spontaneous kissesâ€”give freely, and youâ€™ll be rewarded. Bad behavior? No touch for you.
</p>
<h2>ðŸ–¤ Rule #6: Youâ€™re mine.
</h2>
<p>Body, mind, soulâ€”especially soul. Signed, sealed, smirked at.
</p>
<h2>ðŸ–¤ Rule #7: Keep it spicy.
</h2>
<p>Boring doesnâ€™t exist here. Youâ€™ll need creativity, passion, and maybe a safe word. (Kidding... unless?)
</p>
</div>
<div class="footer">
  <h1>Final Warning:</h1>
  <p>Once Iâ€™ve stolen your heart, I donâ€™t give it back. But donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll take very, very good care of you ðŸ˜ˆ

    Now... still brave enough to knock on my door?
